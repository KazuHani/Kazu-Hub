# AGENTS.md — Kazu Hub

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository. Read this first.

## Project overview

Kazu Hub is a personal hub page for Kazu Hani ("Arctic Dragon ❄️🐉"), deployed
as a static site on GitHub Pages at `https://kazuhani.github.io/Kazu-Hub/`
(repo: `KazuHani/Kazu-Hub`, default branch `Main`).

Stack: **vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only. No framework, no build step, no package
manager, no dependencies.** There is no `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, or
any other manifest — do not add one. The only tooling is Node (used solely to
run the headless test file) and a static file server for local preview.

The page shows: live stat cards (UK time, Aberystwyth weather, age, birthday
countdown) with detail pop-ups; a "right now" section with live Discord
presence (Lanyard, WebSocket + REST fallback), Steam status, MyAnimeList
watching/reading (Jikan, falling back to MAL list endpoints through
`corsproxy.io`), and the latest Letterboxd diary entry (RSS via the same
proxy); a YouTube Music playlist card whose "From the playlist" rows update
themselves from the playlist's Atom feed (`feeds/videos.xml`, via the same
proxy, newest additions first), plus a ListenBrainz "recently played" strip;
socials; and in-progress stories. It is installable as a PWA-lite (manifest +
`sw.js` offline shell), a single time-of-day-reactive palette (a soft
slate blue that lightens towards midday and dims towards sunset/night,
driven by `KazuLib.skyTint` on the UK clock — there is no theme toggle),
seasonal themes (birthday,
Christmas, pride), a weather-reactive cherry-blossom atmosphere (petals
detach from the branches and drift down-wind; the layer is anchored to the
top of the page, so it scrolls away with the hero), a "moonlit sakura"
scenery layer (SVG branches from the page edges plus a sun-by-day /
moon-by-night sky body arcing left→right on the UK clock; hidden during
the Christmas season), and custom scrollbars.

## Code layout

- `index.html` (~750 lines) — the whole page. Loads `style.css?v=35`,
  `lib.js?v=21`, `script.js?v=43` (version query strings; see cache-busting
  below). Inline JSON-LD schema in the `<head>`.
- `lib.js` (~930 lines) — **pure, DOM-free helpers**, exposed as the global
  `KazuLib` (works in browser and Node). Single source of truth for the birth
  config (`BIRTH = { year: 2001, month: 10, day: 9 }`, month 0-indexed), the
  Europe/London wall-clock frame, UK DST maths, age/birthday calculations
  (including the playful equivalents in `ageBreakdown`: full moons, Sun laps,
  years asleep, breaths), calendar export (`.ics`, Google Calendar URL), HTML
  escaping, Steam/MAL data shaping, dev-code matching, scrollbar thumb
  geometry, and the sun/moon sky-arc maths (`sunTimesUK`, `skyBodyState`).
- `script.js` (~2400 lines) — all DOM behaviour: stat cards and modals,
  particles/atmosphere, themes and seasons, live API integrations (Lanyard,
  Steam, Jikan/MAL, Letterboxd, YouTube playlist feed, ListenBrainz,
  ZenQuotes), custom scrollbars,
  the `kazudev` dev panel. It consumes `KazuLib` but keeps inline fallbacks
  for the lib helpers it needs, so the page still works if `lib.js` fails to
  load. User-facing IDs (`DISCORD_ID`, `STEAM_VANITY`, `MAL_USER`, `LB_USER`,
  `LISTENBRAINZ_USER`) are constants near the top of each section.
- `style.css` (~1440 lines) — all styling, including seasonal and
  weather-atmosphere variants and the sakura scenery layer.
- `sw.js` — service worker. Network-first for navigations, cache-first for
  same-origin versioned assets, cross-origin requests (live APIs, fonts)
  untouched. Precache list mirrors the `?v=` URLs from `index.html`.
- `tests.js` — headless gate tests for `lib.js`, plain Node, no dependencies.
- `tests.html` — the same assertions run in the browser (open the file).
- `404.html`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `site.webmanifest` — static
  plumbing. `assets/` holds images/icons.
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` — the only CI (see Testing).

## Run locally

Static site — open `index.html` directly, or serve the folder:

```
python -m http.server 8000
# → http://localhost:8000
```

Preview/dev affordances built into the page:

- `?season=birthday|christmas|pride|all` (comma-combinable) forces seasonal
  themes on any date. The `?season=` param wins over the dev panel.
- `?atmosphere=rain|blossom|blossom-heavy|aurora|none` forces the particle mode.
- Typing `kazudev` anywhere on the page opens a dev settings panel with
  per-season Auto/On/Off overrides persisted to localStorage. Typing it again
  or Esc closes it.

## Testing

`lib.js` is deliberately DOM-free so it can be tested in two places:

- **Headless:** `node tests.js` — no dependencies, no network, <1s.
  Exit code 0 = pass, 1 = at least one failure.
- **Browser:** open `tests.html` — same assertions.

CI (`.github/workflows/test.yml`, "gate tests") runs `node tests.js` on every
push to `Main` and on PRs, under three timezones (`TZ=UTC`,
`TZ=Pacific/Kiritimati`, `TZ=America/Los_Angeles`) to prove the UK wall-clock
maths is machine-independent. Keep the suite passing under all three; any new
deterministic helper in `lib.js` needs matching assertions in both `tests.js`
and `tests.html`.

There is no test framework — assertions are hand-rolled `ok`/`eq` helpers.
Follow that pattern.

## Conventions and gotchas

These are load-bearing; read before editing.

- **Cache busting.** CSS/JS are versioned by query string. After editing
  `style.css`, `script.js`, or `lib.js`: bump the `?v=` in `index.html` (and
  in `tests.html` for `lib.js`), keep the matching entries in `sw.js`'s
  `PRECACHE` list in sync, and bump `CACHE` in `sw.js` if `sw.js` itself
  changes.
- **Staged boot & populate animation.** Startup work runs in priority order,
  not all at once: first API fetches ride the `firstDelay` ladder in the
  `POLLERS` array (stretch gaps via `bootGap`), heavy layers wait for
  `scheduleIdle`, and the glass-map bake runs in idle slices. When a live
  card's data arrives, swap its loading row out through `popReveal(loadedEl,
  loadingEl)` — never raw `classList` toggles — so the content fades/rises in
  and the card's height glides to fit. Both paths must stay free for
  low-power (`LOW_POWER`) and reduced-motion devices (instant swap).
  Any new always-on animated layer (infinite CSS loops, canvas rAF) must
  register with `fxWatch(el)` so it pauses off-screen via `.fx-paused`.
- **Social tiles are solid brand tiles.** `.social-card` is deliberately NOT
  a `.card` member (no glass/refraction — nothing to refract through). The
  design hangs off two custom properties: each network gets a
  `.social-card--<name>` rule in style.css with `--brand-a` (centre, lighter)
  and `--brand-b` (edge, darker); the bevel, gloss, badge and hover are all
  inherited. To add a social: copy a tile in index.html, swap href / badge /
  name / handle, add one modifier rule — then bump the tile count in the
  structural assertions in tests.js and tests.html.
- **Timezone rule.** Anything age/birthday-related must run in the
  Europe/London wall-clock frame via `KazuLib.ukWallParts` / `ukWallMs`
  (calendar arithmetic happens in a fake-UTC frame so results are identical on
  any machine). Never reintroduce visitor-local `Date` getters for those
  paths.
- **lib.js is the single source of truth.** Deterministic maths belongs in
  `lib.js` (DOM-free, gate-tested). `script.js` consumes it via `KazuLib` with
  inline fallbacks in case the file fails to load — when you add a lib helper
  used by the page, mirror that fallback pattern.
- **HTML escaping.** API-sourced strings (Steam game names, MAL titles, etc.)
  go through `KazuLib.escapeHtml` before any `innerHTML` interpolation.
- **Style.** Plain ES5-ish in `lib.js` (`var`, function expressions, IIFE
  attaching to a global), modern JS (arrow functions, `const`/`let`) in
  `script.js` and `sw.js`. Heavy header-comment banners explain intent at the
  top of each file and each section; match that density. 2-space indent.
- **Service worker.** `sw.js` must never serve stale content while online:
  network-first for pages, versioned-URL cache-first for assets, and live
  APIs always fetched fresh. Preserve that strategy.
- **localStorage keys in use:** `kazu-dev-seasons`, `kazu-mal-cache`,
  `kazu-mal-manga-cache`, `kazu-lb-cache`, `kazu-ytm-cache`.
  Don't collide.

## Working agreements (from CLAUDE.md)

The repo carries a `CLAUDE.md` with the owner's working rules; the ones that
bind agent work here:

- Tests ship with the change, in the same commit. "I'll add tests later" is
  not acceptable. Gate tests must stay deterministic, local, free, and fast.
- Vanilla by default. No frameworks, no new dependencies, no build tooling.
  Check for an existing library/pattern before writing custom code; don't
  recreate what exists.
- Deterministic work (date maths, transforms, escaping) goes in code with
  tests, not in ad-hoc reasoning.
- Safety: never commit secrets (check `.gitignore` if `.env` is ever touched);
  no destructive ops (`rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, force push) or skipping
  hooks without explicit confirmation; no binaries or compiled outputs in the
  repo.
- When done, commit and push (the owner's `.claude/settings.local.json`
  pre-allows `git add/commit/push`), and state what needs restarting — for
  this site, a push to `Main` redeploys GitHub Pages automatically; nothing
  else restarts.

## Deployment

Push to `Main` → GitHub Pages serves the repo root as-is. There is no build,
no bundler, no environment variables, no server-side component. Cache-busting
bumps (above) are the entire "release process" for CSS/JS changes.
